# PacoElChatoLiveChat_pythondjango

Many of the languages used in this project have been new to me at the time I've started this project. Thus in order to achieve this it I've followed the LiveChat series from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoNZZLhPuuRteu02rh7bzsw (account management and the better part of the UI), and in order to find my way around the websockets I've done a little reading on https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ and worked upon some code shown in there. The name of the chat and also most if not all the graphics used are property of https://pacoelchato.com/, a spanish educational website for children.

By the end of the project, I feel I've gotten more comfortable working with HTML, CSS and javascript(although this is my very first project using these languages and I'm sure I've done nothing but scratch the surface of what they have to offer), and also with using Django as the foundation of the application.
